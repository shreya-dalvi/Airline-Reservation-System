# Airline Reservation System

**Introduction:** The system enables the customer to do things such as search for airline flights between two cities on a specified date, choose a flight based on the details, and make a reservation for a flight. The system allows the airline passenger to search for flights that are available between the two travel cities, namely the "Departure City" and "Arrival City" for a particular departure and arrival date. After searching, the system displays a list of available flights and allows the customer to choose a particular flight. The purpose of the Airlines Reservation System is to automate the existing manual system with the help of computerised equipment and full-fledged computer software, fulfilling their requirements so that their valuable data and information can be stored for a longer period with easy access and manipulation. The aim is to automate its existing manual system, thereby fulfilling user requirements so that their valuable data and information can be stored for a longer period with easy access and manipulation.

**Proposed System:** The project's purpose is to create an airline reservation system that allows users to search for flights based on origin, destination, and travel date, reserve flights, track flights, use a cashless payment method, and download a softcopy of the boarding pass.
The project is designed to display available flights within a given source and destination for the specified date, mentioning the airline name, prices, arrival time, and departure time, allowing the user to choose the desired flight from the available possibilities, and reserve a ticket via cashless payment methods. There is also an option to download a softcopy of the boarding pass. In addition to the reservation system, the flight allows users to track flights using their PNR number and name. Flight details such as arrival and departure times, source and destination are displayed in the flight tracking section.
